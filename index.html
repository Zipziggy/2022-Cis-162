    <p>My Name is Pedro Torres I am a Veteran. My education goals are a programing degree. I spend most of my time working or on my computer. I do take some time to read a few books. I did start this class last year but as always life gets in the way and now I find myself retaking the course. My goals for this class are just to pass it and learn everything I can about Html and CSS.</p>
